Extensible Image Format with Lossless Compression."</p><p><strong>Why SPUPNG?</strong></p><p>The SPUPNG format is intended for use with authoring DVDs. The SPUPNG
format does a better job of preserving the original closed caption
format than the text based formats supported by ccextractor. Some of the
problems with the text based formats are:</p><ul><li><p>They lose row information. Closed captions can be displayed anywhere in a grid of 15 rows by 32 columns. But the text based formats do not indicate on what rows the captions should be displayed. So most applications will display captions near the bottom of the video, where most closed captions are usually placed. However, there are times when the video contains information that closed caption authors take care to not obscure by placing captions on the top rows, and sometimes even in the middle of a video. Captions are often placed at the top of video when the video is displaying text, such as credits, or the name of a speaker in a documentary.</p></li><li><p>They may lose column information. ccextractor provides whitespace in the text based formats so it is clear where captions should be placed horizontally. But some applications ignore the leading whitespace and simply center the text horizontally. In addition, fonts used to display captions are often proportional width fonts. If the user doesn’t (or cannot) configure the application to use a fixed width font, the way captions are laid out horizontally can be skewed. Information, such as whether the person to the left or right of the video is speaking, can be lost.</p></li><li><p>They usually don’t look like closed captions. Perhaps this isn’t a bad thing, but if you like the look of closed captions, you’ll like the SPUPNG format.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Some examples</strong></p><p>A picture is worth a thousand words. So here are some screenshots that
show how the same caption in the same scene is displayed depending on
the ccextractor output format, how an application displays the caption,
and how the user configures the application to display the caption. The
scene in question has two people engaged in conversation, the caption
captures what both people are saying, and it is near the beginning of
the show, so credits are displayed near the bottom of the scene.</p><picture class=nav_logo data-lit=https://ccextractor-website.netlify.app/images/spupng/srt-file.png data-dark=https://ccextractor-website.netlify.app/images/spupng/srt-file.png><source srcset=https://ccextractor-website.netlify.app/images/spupng/srt-file.png media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img srcset=https://ccextractor-website.netlify.app/images/spupng/srt-file.png alt></picture><p>The above screenshot shows how a SRT formatted caption is displayed by
VLC using VLC's default configuration where captions are displayed using
the Arial font. Both people are talking, but can you tell who is saying
what? Can you read the credit? Here is how the caption is encoded in the
.srt file:</p><pre><code>20

                   Wow. How long
                  did that take?

you can tell who is saying what, but it is still hard to read the
credit.</p><picture class=nav_logo data-lit=https://ccextractor-website.netlify.app/images/spupng/smi-file.png data-dark=https://ccextractor-website.netlify.app/images/spupng/smi-file.png><source srcset=https://ccextractor-website.netlify.app/images/spupng/smi-file.png media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img srcset=https://ccextractor-website.netlify.app/images/spupng/smi-file.png alt></picture><p>The above screenshot shows how a SAMI formatted caption is displayed by
VLC after VLC's Subtitles/OSD preferences have been configured to use a
fixed width font, Lucida Console, and the "Add a background" option has
been checked. Here is how the caption is encoded in the .smi file:</p><pre><code>&lt;SYNC start=135636&gt;&lt;P class=&quot;UNKNOWNCC&quot;&gt;

&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/SYNC&gt;
</code></pre><p>Who is speaking is clear in the .smi file, but not when VLC displays the
caption. And the credit is even harder to read with the "Add a
background" option enabled.</p><picture class=nav_logo data-lit=https://ccextractor-website.netlify.app/images/spupng/spusmi.png data-dark=https://ccextractor-website.netlify.app/images/spupng/spusmi.png><source srcset=https://ccextractor-website.netlify.app/images/spupng/spusmi.png media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img srcset=https://ccextractor-website.netlify.app/images/spupng/spusmi.png alt></picture><p>The above screenshot shows how spumux renders the same SAMI formatted

caption. It is clear who is saying what, and the credit is not obscured
by the caption.</p><p><strong>How to use the SPUPNG output format</strong></p><p>The SPUPNG format was designed to be used with the dvdauthor tool,
spumux. According to the <a href=http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/>dvdauthor homepage</a>: "DVDAuthor is a
set of tools to help you author the file and directory structure of a
DVD-Video disc, including programmatic commands for implementing
interactive behaviour." According to the <a href=http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/doc/r2515.html>spumux manpage</a>:
"spumux -- generates and multiplexes subtitles into an existing mpeg2
program stream"</p><p>This section describes how to use the SPUPNG format to create a very
simple DVD-Video that plays one video. The procedure assumes a computer
with a DVD burner running a Ubuntu flavor of Linux with the dvdauthor,
ffmpeg (or libav-tools) and dvd+rw-tools packages installed. The tools
in these packages are designed to be used from the command line and the
dvdauthor tools are driven by XML files. A number of graphical user
interface front ends for these packages are also available, some of
which have been ported to Windows, along with the underlying dvdauthor
and ffmpeg/libav-tools packages. More information can be found at the
<a href=http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/>dvdauthor home page</a>. I
have not used any of the Windows applications, so their use is beyond my
area of expertise.</p><ul><li>Extract closed captions in SPUPNG format</li></ul><p><code>ccextractor -out=spupng -o spumux.xml source-video-file</code></p><p>This command will create the file, spumux.xml and a sub-directory,
spumux.d. The sub-directory will contain lots of PNG files named
subNNNN.png where NNNN is the 4 digit number of a closed caption
starting at 0000. For example, the source video file used for the
example screenshots, was one hour long and generated 1052 PNG files
named sub0000.png to sub1052.png. Longer videos or videos with roll-up
captions will generate more PNG files.</p><ul><li>Transcode video to DVD-Video format</li></ul><p>Different Linux distributions will support either the ffmpeg package or
the libav-tools package. The ffmpeg/avconv programs are complex and
require many command line options to get the desired result. I maintain
a shell script, do-ffmpeg, which I edit as needed to select:</p><ul><li>Cropping options, useful when the source video is letterboxed,</li><li>Video bit rate (which determines how many hours can fit on a DVD with a tradeoff on quality),</li><li>Video resolution (the DVD standard allows four different resolutions for NTSC and PAL each, I will usually use the most common, 720×480, but if the source video width is 704, I will use 704×480),</li><li>Audio codec. I always try to copy the source video audio, but sometimes there is noise in the source that throws audio and video out of sync. In that case, I use options that transcode the audio and help maintain a/v sync.</li><li>Whether to deinterlace. I usually do.</li><li>Aspect ratio, either. 16:9 or 4:3.</li></ul><p>Here is the do-ffmpeg script for ffmpeg version 0.6:</p><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# Transcode video to DVD-Video compatible format.

# Usage: do-ffmpeg infile outfile

if [ $# != 2 ]
then
echo &quot;Usage: do-ffmpeg infile outfile&quot;

# options of interest (applicable to ffmpeg version 0.6):

# Cropping:
# If a widescreen video is letterboxed in a 4:3 aspect ratio,
# you might want to crop the letterboxed format, using the following:
#crop=&quot;-croptop 60 -cropbottom 60&quot;
# Sometimes you get a 4:3 video that's been letterboxed on the sides, too:

# The numbers need to be adjusted for the source video resolution

# Bitrate determines the size and quality of the video:
# 4670k = approx 2 hours of video on a 4.7GB single layer DVD
# 3200k = approx 3 hours of video on a 4.7GB single layer DVD
# 2400k = approx 4 hours of video on a 4.7GB single layer DVD

# Video resolution:
# Valid values for NTSC DVD-Video are: 720x480 704x480 352x480 352x240
# Valid values for PAL DVD-Video are: 720x576 704x576 352x576 352x288
# I usually use 720x480, unless the input is 704 wide, then I use 704x480
