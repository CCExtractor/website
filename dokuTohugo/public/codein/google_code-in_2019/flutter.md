# Google Code-in 2019/ Flutter

While the tasks themselves can\'t be made public until the GCI starts
officially, we think it\'s OK to explain the kind of things we want to
do for those of you that want to somehow get started - not with the
tasks themselves, which is not possible, but getting prepared to start
working immediately.

If you have already done some basic digging about Flutter, you already
know what it is: A new platform that lets you write apps that will work
both on Android, iOS and web. Most apps have menus, have logins, maybe
access a database or some kind of internet resource, and depending on
the specific app, maybe accesses the device capabilities such as the
camera or location.

The programming language that Flutter uses is Dart, so that\'s something
that you want to look at.

Also, getting Flutter to work may take a bit of time: You can start by
installing it and making sure \"Flutter Doctor\" says everything is
great.

We\'re going to be building a few apps. The goal is that build 3
applications that are actually going to be useful and we hope, popular.
To get there each of them will consist on a large number of small tasks
that anyone can do. Each task will have several instances (so several
students can work on the same thing) and for each we\'ll use the best
one. Of course this doesn\'t mean that the rest completed tasks will not
be accepted. If a task it\'s completed, it will be accepted, and the
student is of course welcome to use his/her own version of that specific
piece of program.

Remember: It\'s open source, so everybody is allowed to have their own
copy and customize it.

#### So what are the applications?

### Bingo

Important: This is \_free\_ bingo. We\'re not building a betting game.
That\'s not interesting at all - but the pieces we\'re going to learn,
are. What are we going to learn here?

\- Menus\\\\ - Drawing on the screen (for example, a grid)\\\\ -
Interactions with a server (we\'re getting the tickets from a server,
and getting the numbers from it)\\\\ - Getting user feedback (where on
the screen did the user press)\\\\

### The food locator

Suppose we are at a place, for example at a conference venue, or a large
university campus, in which food is delivered at different places during
different times of the day (this is a real use case, believe it or not).
When you are hungry, you have to go around the place to find something
to eat. Sometimes it\'s something you like, and sometimes it\'s not. Or
maybe you won\'t find anything.

We\'re going to write an app that shows a map and let users report when
they\'ve seen food where they are. That information will appear to other
users of the app that are in the same place, for example attending the
same conference. Users can also report that food is not there, and also
food can be removed from the map automatically after a certain amount of
time.

Here we\'re going to be learning:

\- Maps\\\\ - Location services\\\\ - Timeouts\\\\ - Interaction with
servers\\\\

### Smart photo app

Build an app that lets you take pictures with the camera and flag them
in a useful way. Also, do special things with them.\\\\

We all know that camera pictures can be geolocated, which means that as
part of the metadata they contain the physical location. We\'re going to
extend that by linking our pictures with things such as the calendar.
For example, if your (Google) Calendar says that at 11:00-11:30 you were
attending a book signing, would it be useful that the picture and the
calendar event were automatically linked together?

Here we\'re going to be learning:

\- Camera\\\\ - Location services\\\\ - Accessing the Google
Calendar\\\\ - Basic AI (details on this will be disclosed with the
tasks)\\\\
