#### Description

My project was to add the capability of extracting burned-in (hard)
subtitles from videos to CCExtractor. As of now, CCExtractor works by
only extracting caption data in the video if it is present in specific
structures in the stream, and skips the actual video data (pixels)
completely. However a lot of videos have hard subtitles burned into
them, extracting which is a computer vision problem, and something which
CCExtractor did not earlier have the capability to process.
