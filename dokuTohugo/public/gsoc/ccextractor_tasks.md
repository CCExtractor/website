# CCExtractor tasks

This page is a compilation of the most important tasks from everyone\'s
proposals. Those of you that are going to be working on the same things
please talk among yourselves.

Add tasks and edit as needed.

We know that there were some proposals that included the exact same
tasks. We preferred to pick the best students and not just the best
proposals for each task. If you find yourself in a situation in which
someone else is doing what you were planning to do, just replace that
task with even a more interesting one :-) Don\'t get frustrated by this
overlap. We are aware of it.
