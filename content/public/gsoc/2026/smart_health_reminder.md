### Project Brief

Many health-tracking apps exist, but they often lack engagement. People set reminders for hydration, movement, or posture correction but ignore them. Let's fix this by gamifying health tracking and integrating it with an open-source alarm/reminder system.

The goal is to make health reminders fun, interactive, and effective by tying them into challenges, achievements, and community engagement while maintaining an ad-free and open-source approach.

### Features We Want

- **Smart Health Reminders**
  - Drink water reminders based on temperature & activity level.
  - Posture correction reminders using phone sensors.
  - Step count goals with periodic nudges.
  - Breathing & meditation reminders based on stress levels.

- **Gamification & Challenges**
  - Users earn points for completing health tasks.
  - Achievements for streaks (e.g., "10 Days Hydrated Hero").
  - Social leaderboard where friends can challenge each other.

- **Integration with Ultimate Alarm Clock (UAC) [Bonus]**
  - Wake-up alarms that adjust based on sleep quality.
  - Personalized alerts based on movement or inactivity.
  - Shared alarms for workout sessions or health goals.

### Features We Don't Care About

- No excessive tracking or data collection.
- No intrusive notifications—only meaningful nudges.
- No complicated analytics dashboards—keep it simple.

### Your Tasks

Your Task is to build this from scratch. It's a new project that combines health tracking, gamification, and a smart alarm/reminder system in an open-source way.
