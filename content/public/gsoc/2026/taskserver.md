## **Project Overview**

CCSync is a sync server, web interface, and integration platform for TaskWarrior III, built on top of the taskchampion sync architecture. TaskWarrior 3.0 support works great with CCSync as of now. Hence, for GSoC 2026, the goal would be to expand the services, extending CCSync to more services, by adding more integrations, improving the overall UI/UX.

This project focuses on:

- Advanced task visualization and usability
- A centralized integration and notification layer
- Offline-first (PWA), multi-device workflows

Making CCSync a complete companion to TaskWarrior across CLI, mobile, and web, along with other services as well.

All features described below are part of the same project and are expected to be implemented within the GSoC period.

## **Project Goals**

- Improve how users can visualize, understand, and manage tasks
- Expand CCSync into a central sync and integration hub
- Provide clear sync transparency and debugging visibility
- Improve accessibility, onboarding, and offline usage
- Keep the system modular, extensible, and self-host friendly
- Codebase refactor, as required for maintainability.

## **Scope & Deliverables**

1. **Data Visualization & UX:** Move beyond list-based task management.
   - **Deliverables:**
     - **Kanban View**
       - Project-based columns
       - Drag-and-drop task movement
     - **Calendar View**
       - Due and scheduled tasks
       - Day / week / month views
     - **Task Graph Flow Diagram**
       - Nodes: tasks
       - Edges: dependencies, shared projects, shared tags
       - Built using Cytoscape.js or D3.js
       - Interactive filtering, hover details, minimap
   - **Advanced Theming**
     - Persistent light/dark themes
     - High-contrast accessibility mode
     - Add color blind modes, etc.
     - Adjustable typography
   - **Text-to-Speech (For Accessibility)**
     - On-demand narration of task dialogs
     - Play / pause / speed controls
     - Fully UI-integrated

2. **Core Sync UX & Transparency**

   TaskWarrior 3.0 sync already works; this track improves clarity and control.

   - **Deliverables:**
     - Clear sync visibility:
       - Sync source (CLI / mobile / web / integration)
       - Better handling of offline-created tasks
       - Improved conflict surfacing in the UI
     - Developer / power-user tooling:
       - Debug views or flags
       - Sync state inspection
       - Better log and error surfacing

3. **Ecosystem & Integrations (High Priority)**

   CCSync should work as a centralized sync hub beyond TaskWarrior-only clients.

   - **Deliverables:**
     - Two-way sync integrations
       - Google Tasks (priority since we already have Oauth)
       - Google Calendar (to be done after integration of our calendar view)
       - Jira
       - Code Host Integration
         - GitHub / GitLab issues via Bugwarrior (only in self-hostable environment)
     - Notification Engine
       - Backend-driven reminders
       - Email notifications
       - Zulip / Slack / Telegram support
     - Integrations should be implemented as opt-in adapters in settings.
       - No impact on core sync performance for users who disable integrations (should be disabled by default)

4. **Progressive Web App & Offline Support (Medium Priority)**
   - **Deliverables:**
     - PWA support for CCSync Web UI to make it more standalone, similar to a mobile/PC app.
     - Offline usage via Web Workers and caching
     - Background sync when network is restored
     - App-like experience without native builds

5. **Account Portability & Data Control (Medium Priority)**
   - **Deliverables:**
     - Bulk task export (JSON) and import can be used to get users onboarded easily
     - Account reset / data wipe tools, with tools like --prune to delete all tasks from our sync server if the user intends to do so.
     - UUID-safe migration utilities, for moving tasks from one account to another, on demand.

6. **Demo & Onboarding Experience (Medium Priority)**
   - **Deliverables:**
     - Mock Demo Instance on Landing page
       - “Try before login”
       - Sample user with preloaded tasks
       - No real credentials required
     - Improved first-time user flow
     - Sample datasets for experimentation that should cover most if not all use cases

7. **Documentation (Required)**
   - **Deliverables:**
     - Updated documentation for:
       - Integrations and adapters
       - Notification system
       - Web UI features
       - Clear “Getting Started” guide
       - Developer-focused contribution notes
       - Updated API Docs at the end period of GSoC.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Backend**
  - Golang
  - taskchampion-based sync
  - Modular adapter architecture
- **Frontend**
  - React
  - Cytoscape.js or D3.js for graphs
  - Tailwind CSS + Shadcn
- **Infrastructure**
  - Docker / Docker Compose
  - Self-host friendly defaults
