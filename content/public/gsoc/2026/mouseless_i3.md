title: "Mouseless for Linux v2 - i3 edition"
---


## Introduction

[Mouseless](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mouseless) is a nice tool to practice keyboard shortcuts for a few popular apps.

The original version has been discontinued and the [source code](https://github.com/ueberdosis/mouseless) has been released. They allow forking!

In 2021 we created a [basic one for Linux](https://github.com/CCExtractor/fastfingers).

This year we'd like to focus on writer an i3wm teaching tool that trains muscle memory to use i3 with the keyboard only.

If you haven't used i3 yet, we recommend the [regolith system](https://regolith-linux.org/) (that's the one we use). If comes completely ready to use - you can install it from USB, or over an existing Ubuntu.


## Your task

We want to create Mouseless for i3. You can start from scratch, you can use their work (check the license though!)... it's up to you.

We recommend you start by actually checking out mouseless to get an idea, and then come up with a plan.

## Qualification tasks

Take a look at [this page](/public/gsoc/takehome).

If none of the suit you (mouseless is written in Javascript) get in touch and suggest something! We don't bite and always welcome good suggestions :-)
