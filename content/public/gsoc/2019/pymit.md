Developed under Google Summer of Code, 2019 with CCExtractor Development
By Amit Kumar

### Introduction

The main aim of the project is to make an open-source version of Amazon
Rekognition which is a (paid) service that is able to identify objects,
people, text, scenes, and activities in a picture. To accomplish this, I
proposed a solution by using tech stacks such as Django,
Django-Rest-Framework, ffmpeg, TensorFlow Serving and ReactJS.
