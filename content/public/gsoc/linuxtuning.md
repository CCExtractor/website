 **Introduction**

The linux kernel has hundreds of tunable settings. Some can be modified
on the fly with sysctl; others require reboots, loading modules and so
on.

 **Your job**

Your job is to come up with a self-tuning system that does all the
analysis it needs and finds the optimum settings to maximize throughput
and/or latency for well defined workloads. One of the must be
BitTorrent, since that one uses a lot of traffic and it can just be
tested with real data instead of synthetic tests.
