# PiPot (A micro honeypot for RPi)

[PiPot](https://github.com/PiPot/PiPot) was developed as part
of a master thesis of one of the main contributors of CCExtractor. Due
to time constraints it didn't see a lot of love the last few years, and
that's where you could come in!

There is a "small" list of improvements that could be made to the
platform, and which we'd love to see implemented, so that the platform
is more usable in general.

The full list is available on the
[issues](https://github.com/PiPot/PiPot/issues) page of the
main repository, but is not exhaustive. We'd also love to see some
integrations with other existing honeypots.

##### Getting started / Requirements

The honeypot software is written in Python, so we expect good knowledge
of Python. Basic HTML, Javascript & CSS knowledge is also required. Bash
scripting knowledge will also be required for the tasks.

We make use of quite some libraries, and we expect you to read up on the
documentation of these platforms so you know how they work in
general.

#### Qualification

If you are interested in taking up this project during GSoC, you will
need to satisfy these requirements (in order of importance, not all are
a necessity):  - A well researched, well written project
proposal. - Proof you've set up PiPot locally on a Raspberry Pi
(preferred), or on your local PC. - Fixed a bug, improved
installation documentation, \... (contributed something to the
project). - Have chatted with the mentor(s) at least once.

##### Mentor(s)

\- Willem Van Iseghem (\@canihavesomecoffee on Slack) is a former GSoC
student (2014, 2015, 2016) and mentor (2017, 2018). He wrote the
software for his Master thesis and is the official (and currently sole)
maintainer.
