## **Project Overview**

[TaskWarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) is a powerful command-line task management tool that helps users manage their tasks efficiently through a terminal interface. It offers task synchronization, advanced filtering, and script-based integration via CLI.

## However, despite its power, **TaskWarrior lacks a modern cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI)** that can match its CLI capabilities. To bridge this gap, we built a **Flutter-based mobile app** for TaskWarrior that allows users to:

## âœ… **What We Achieved Last Year (2024)**

Last year, we made significant progress by:

- ðŸš€ **Migrating most of the codebase to GetX** for better state management.
- ðŸ’¾ Enabling sync with **TaskServer 2.0 (TS 2.0)**.
- ðŸ“± Improving the mobile appâ€™s usability and performance.
- Unit tests

However, a few key challenges still remain:

- Some parts of the app **still use the old provider-based state management**, so we want to complete the migration to **GetX**.
- We **havenâ€™t fully integrated CCSync/TaskServer 3.0** (which we built separately), and our app only supports TaskServer 2.0.
- We lack automated build releases (to **F-Droid**) and automated testing workflows.
- There's **no iOS home widget** for quick task access.
- Desktop optimization is still missing despite Flutter's growing desktop support.

---

## âœ… **Your Task for This Year (2025)**

This year, we aim to **finalize the TaskWarrior app** by:

1. **Completing the migration to GetX**.
2. **Extending sync support for CCSync (TaskServer 3.0)** without breaking existing TaskServer 2.0 support.
3. **Automating nightly builds via F-Droid and GitHub Actions**.
4. **Building an iOS home screen widget** for quick task access.
5. **Optimizing the app for desktop usage (macOS)**.
6. **Ensuring complete test coverage** (unit, integration, end-to-end).
7. **Simplifying codebase architecture** and reducing unnecessary bloat.
8. **Maintaining the core TaskWarrior philosophy** â€” minimal, fast, and powerful.

---

## **Key Deliverables**

### âœ… **1. Complete Migration to GetX (High Priority)**

- A large portion of the app has already been migrated to **GetX**, but some modules still use **heavy setState** for state management.
- Your task will be to:
  - ðŸš€ Move the remaining sections to **GetX**.
  - ðŸ’¡ Ensure state management is clean, reusable, and optimized.
  - âœ… Remove redundant code and reduce app bloat.
- This will future-proof the app and improve scalability.

---

### âœ… **2. Integrate CCSync (TaskServer 3.0) Without Breaking TaskServer 2.0**

- **Current State:** The app supports sync only with **TaskServer 2.0**.
- **Goal:** Extend support for **CCSync/TaskServer 3.0** without breaking existing TaskWarrior 2.0 functionality.
- **Tasks:**
  - ðŸ”„ **Create separate data models** for TaskServer 2.0 and TaskServer 3.0.
  - ðŸ’¡ Implement an UI to allow user which taskserver they want to use for different profiles.
  - ðŸ“¡ Provide seamless sync functionality for both versions.
  - ðŸ’¬ **Collaborate with CCSync developers** to ensure full compatibility.

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** Some groundwork has already been done to integrate CCSync, so your job will be to **improve, optimize, and finalize** the integration.

---

### âœ… **3. Build Full Test Coverage (Must-Have)**

- The app currently lacks complete test coverage. Your task will be to:
  - ðŸš€ Write **unit tests** for all major functionalities.
  - ðŸ§ª Implement **integration tests** to ensure seamless task sync.
  - âœ… Enable **end-to-end testing** using Flutter integration tests.
  - ðŸ“Š Achieve **at least 90% test coverage** across the codebase.

This will ensure production-level stability and prevent future bugs.

---

### âœ… **4. Automate Nightly Builds (to F-Droid + GitHub Actions)**

- One major issue is that our app doesnâ€™t have automated builds.
- Your task will be to:
  - ðŸ¤– Setup **F-Droid** for nightly builds.
  - ðŸ”„ Create **GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows** that automatically:
    - Build APK and AAB packages.
    - Push releases to **F-Droid**.
    - Notify on failures via GitHub Actions.
- This will drastically simplify app distribution for users.

---

### âœ… **5. Develop an iOS Home Widget for Quick Task Access**

- Create an iOS home screen widget that allows users to:
  - âœ… View pending tasks.
  - âœ… Mark tasks as completed.
  - âœ… Add new tasks quickly.
- This will significantly improve user retention for iOS users.
- Android widget is already done : https://github.com/CCExtractor/taskwarrior-flutter/pull/417

---

### âœ… **6. Optimize Desktop Support (macOS/Linux)**

- Since **Flutter now supports desktop**, we want to optimize TaskWarrior to:
  - âœ… Run smoothly on **macOS/Linux/Windows desktops**.
  - âœ… Provide a desktop-friendly UI/UX.
  - âœ… Sync tasks seamlessly across desktop and mobile.
- This will position **TaskWarrior** as a powerful multi-platform task manager.

---

### âœ… **7. Ensure No Feature Regression**

- One of our biggest concerns is **breaking existing functionality**.
- Your task is to ensure that:
  - âœ… TaskServer 2.0 sync continues to work as-is.
  - âœ… TaskServer 3.0 integration works without conflict.
  - âœ… The app does not introduce unnecessary bloat or complexity.

---

### âœ… **8. iOS App**

- Release the first version of the Flutter app in AppStore
- Test all the features and make sure all works.

### âœ… **9. Propose Minimalist Improvements (Optional but Appreciated)**

- We **don't want to make TaskWarrior bloated** like other task managers.
- However, we encourage you to propose:
  - Minimalist UI improvements.
  - Feature enhancements that **align with TaskWarriorâ€™s philosophy**.
  - Improvements that boost productivity without adding complexity.

---

## âœ… **Why Is This Project Important?**

By completing this project, youâ€™ll help:

- ðŸš€ Make **TaskWarrior a powerful cross-platform task manager**.
- ðŸ”„ Provide seamless sync between mobile, desktop, and CLI.
- ðŸ“² Improve the overall user experience for TaskWarrior users.
- ðŸ’¾ Ensure TaskWarrior remains fast, minimal, and focused.

We donâ€™t want bloat â€” we want **efficiency, speed, and simplicity**.

---
