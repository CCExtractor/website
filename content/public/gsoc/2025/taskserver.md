**175 hours**

## Project Brief
[TaskWarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) is a powerful command-line tool for task management. It offers task synchronization across devices, script integration via CLI, and robust filtering capabilities.

[TaskServer](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccsync) is a daemon that facilitates task sharing across different client applications, primarily TaskWarrior.

Last year, we worked on CCSync (TaskServer), and this year, our goal is to make it production-ready and ship it to users.
