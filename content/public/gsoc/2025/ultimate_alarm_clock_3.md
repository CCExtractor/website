### Project Brief

There's plenty of alarm clocks for mobile, of course. But the most decent ones are expensive. Some even have subscriptions. Really, for a clock? They cost more than an actual physical clock.

Last year we decided to put an end to this nonsense :-) and we came up with a very different alarm clock. The [project](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock) took traction and some of us are already using it as our primary alarm clock. 

### Status

The app is already very usable. We recommend you give it a try to get an idea on why it's different. You will see shared alarms, conditional alarms, and more. 

This year we intend to add a few more features and then release it to the app store. If you're wondering why we haven't done it already - the reason is that an alarm clock is "mission critical". You can't really release a work in progress because free or not, if it doesn't wake people up they're going to be furious.

Here's some of the things we want to add:

- iPhone version. This is mostly a wish, because during development on Android we found several gotchas as a result of using flutter - things that native apps can do easily but that flutter apps can't do without help. We hope to find a smart person with an iPhone up to the challenge, but if you don't have one, keep reading anyway.
- Negative condition alarms. For example, we have the condition to cancel the alarm if you are not in a specific location (for example, don't ring if I'm not home), but not "only ring if I'm home". There's a few things like this that can be improved.
- "Shared alarm" notification -> When I send an alarm with someone, send an in-app notification so they can accept or not.
- Alarm history. Yes. No one has that. But our system is a bit more complicated, and for each alarm that trigger *or* didn't trigger, we need to have a good record of what was considered. Why didn't it ring? Was it raining maybe? Location? We need this to troubleshoot.
- Timezone support. This is in two variants: One, is of course to set the alarm to ring on specific timezones, for example 8:30 California time (regardless of the user time zone). This is useful obviously for meetings.
- Google calendar integration. Yes, Google calendar has its own notifications, but they're not designed to wake you up, and of course it misses the rest of the conditions. Example: Ring if I have an event of my "football calendar" only if I'm home.

### Features we don't care about

We don't want a lot of bloat. There's lots of alarm clocks that do things like sleep tracking (which you can do much better with a dedicated app), lulabys...

There's 350 hours in this project, and the goal is to have a good alarm clock that stands out. 

We don't want a clone of anything that already exists.

### Your Job

Add most of all of the features listed, and come up with new ones in the proposal.

### Qualification tasks

Take a look at [this page](/public/gsoc/takehome). Any Flutter task will do.
