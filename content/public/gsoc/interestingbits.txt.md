 **Detect Automatically the most interesting bits of sample
        videos\*\*

Write software that is able to detect, for some kind of videos, the most
interesting bits (highlights). You can use:

\- Audio (for example,
[\|detect](https://archive.cnx.org/contents/a7ec0ec7-9093-4f55-93ef-3ac2ce71b1c8@3/anatomy-of-a-laugh-track)
[\|laughs](http://archive.cnx.org/contents/8ffeeb0f-fb40-4d3e-a63f-aaff422f9eab@2/primary-detection-methods-for-laugh-tracks))\\\\
- Video (for example, detect high speed scenes or score changes)\\\\ -
Subtitles

At a minimum, the following must be detected:\\\\ - Goals in soccer
([previous work
exists](http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/07/04/automatic-soccer-highlights-compilations-with-python/);
you can build on it or reimplement)\\\\ - Three pointers in
basketball\\\\ - Jokes in sitcoms\\\\ Plus any other 5 use cases you
want to work on.
