title: "Season of Docs 2019"
---

This page is in constant development. We add things as we think of them.
It's not exhaustive, and we're open to ideas brought by the technical
writers as well.

### CCExtractor Website

- Rework our website, which is based on dokuwiki. We're happy to
switch to any other software that the technical writer is comfortable
with.

### User documentation 

- We have a help screen (which is also exported as a "man" page) that
shows all the options, but it's just a list of parameters. Not a lot of
examples (meaning maybe 1 or 2), no proper fonts... it could definitely
use a do over.

- Our user tutorials are hopelessly outdated. There's one to process a
DVD, and a basic how-to. We need to generate a number of interest use
cases.

- Write scripts for youtube videos. We don't need you to actually
produce the videos (but that would be fantastic, of course). The
important thing is the script. We can get someone to read it.

### Developer documentation 

- Tutorials on how to do a number of things: Write a new decoder, write
a new encoder, how to integrate CCExtractor with other tools,
compiling...

- Help us write an official "onboarding" tutorial to help new
developers join the team without feeling overwhelmed by our code base.

### Sample Platform

- Write official documentation (a tutorial) on how to properly perform
an install of the Sample Platform.

- Help with "onboarding" tutorials

- Proper documentation generation based on the python docstrings.

### Google Summer of Code documentation

- Our current documentation for past GSoC projects is "free style",
and there's definitely a broad range of quality, possibly because of
that. While we don't want to limit great writers by enforcing a
specific style it's probably a good idea to have some "baseline" so
that less gifted writers can deliver a minimum of quality. It's a pity
when a good project gets less-than-stellar documentation.

### Google Summer of Code Ideas pages

- We can use help here. Really. We do our best to produce interesting
ideas and amazing projects to work on but we seem to be failing on
delivery. Given our ideas page for 2019 (some of them will appear in 2020) 
- how can be reorganize the content so that it's clearer, more
interesting...?
