### Project Brief

There's plenty of alarm clocks for mobile, of course. But the most decent ones are expensive. Some even have subscriptions. Really, for a clock? They cost more than an actual physical clock.

We want to put an end to this nonsense :-) Let's build a good alarm clock that has features that the rest don't and that it's open source, free, no ads, etc.

### Features we want

Most of the standard features are quite straight forward, so let's no list them as they're obvious. Let's focus on non-standard features. For example:

- Alarm conditional to location. For example:  
     - Ring only at 4:25 pm if and only if I'm at work, because I need to leave. Don't ring otherwise.  
     - Ring only at 7:30 am if and only if I'm at home, because I need to wake up.  
- Alarm conditional to phone activity, for example:  
     - Ring only if I haven't used the phone in the past 10 minutes. Otherwise don't, because I'm already awake.
- Alarms conditional to weather, for example:  
     - Ring only if it's sunny, otherwise I'm not going anywhere :-)  
- Shared alarms so other people can adjust them, for example:  
     - If I have to pick someone one up let that person remove the alarm if they no longer need picking up.  

### Features we don't care about

We don't want a lot of bloat. There's lots of alarm clocks that do things like sleep tracking (which you can do much better with a dedicated app), lulabys...

There's 350 hours in this project, and the goal is to have a good alarm clock that stands out. 

We don't want a clone of anything that already exists.

### Your Job

Your job is to build this from scratch. There's nothing done, it's a new project.

### Qualification tasks
