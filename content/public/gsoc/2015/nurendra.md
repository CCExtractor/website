##### Contribution to blog

The subtitles generated by CCExtractor can now be translated and be made
available to a larger audience due to the realtime translation tool.\\\\
The tool uses Google Translate and Apertium to provide online and
offline translation respectively.\\\\ The Statistics website collects
data from Twitter using Twitter API, from TV advertisements\\\\ using
CCExtractor and shows it effects on the Stock Price which are updated
using Google \\\\ Finance. This will be very useful for opinion
collection and looking at the effects of\\\\ advertisements on Social
Media.
