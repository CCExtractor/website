Welcome

This is CCExtractor\'s GSOC 2015 Wiki.

Red Hen has another document system (generic, not GSoC-specific), please
ask Mark or Francis for access. It is fine to create Red Hen pages here
(by anyone) if it\'s found to be more convenient.

About this wiki:

-   Anyone with access can edit existing pages and create new ones.\\\\
-   It is expected to contain all relevant information. If it\'s not
    here it doesn\'t exist :-)\\\\
-   It will eventually contain sensitive information (such as
    passwords), therefore make sure your own access credentials to the
    wiki are not shared with 3rd parties.\\\\
-   We use dokuwiki. It\'s quite easy to use, but you should check out
    [its
    documentation](http://gsocwiki.ccextractor.org/doku.php?id=wiki:syntax)
    before you start editing.\\\\
