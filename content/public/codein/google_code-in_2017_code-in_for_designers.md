 title: "Google Code-in 2017 for designers"

This year we are going to have some hard design tasks to bring design up
to par with coding. Hard means that they are going to take time and
talent to produce the quality results we want.

At least one of our finalists will be a designer even if he or she has
not contributed code. We are doing this to prevent the design tasks
being treated just as an easy way to complete beginner tasks. For
example, you can create a T-Shirt design in 10 minutes, but that's very
unlikely to be good and usable to well, actually make T-Shirts with it.

If you are serious about becoming a great designer and are willing to do
serious work, look for tasks with the "HardDesign" tasks. At least one
of the students that does a great job on those will be a finalist, and
maybe a winner.

Remember though that hard means hard. Don't expect us to approve the
first design you come up with. We will give you feedback and work with
you until you produce something that you can be proud of for years and
that we can use.

Also, as a bonus, if the design is for something physical (T-Shirt,
sticker, etc) we will ship you one totally free to any part of the
world.
