### Slack

Slack is a great communication tool. Most CCExtractor developers hang
out in a slack team. You're welcome to request an invitation here:

### Technical issues

By far the best way to get report issues is by opening a ticket at
[GitHub's issue
tracker](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor/issues).

When creating a ticket:

- Make sure you are using the last CCExtractor version.
- If it's a new thing (for example a video file that a previous CCExtractor version processed OK and now causes a crash) mention the last version you know was correct.
- If the issue is about a specific file, make that file available for us. Don't just send us the output from CCExtractor, we can't do anything about a screenshot that shows a crash, we need the input that actually causes it. Preferably you make it available for us on the [Sample Platform](https://sampleplatform.ccextractor.org/), but you can also upload the file to Dropbox, Google Drive, etc, and add a download link to your ticket.
- If you cannot make the file public for any (reasonable) reason you can send us a private invitation (both Dropbox and Google Drive allow that). In this case we will download the file and upload it to the private developer repository.
- Do not upload your file to any location that will require us to sign up or endure a wait list, slow downloads, etc.
- If your upload expires make sure you keep it active somehow (replace links if needed). Keep in mind that while we go over all tickets some may take a few days, and it's important we have the file available when we actually need it.
- Make sure you set an alert in GitHub so you get notifications about your ticket. We may need to ask questions and we do everything inside GitHub's system.
- Please use English.
- It goes without saying, we like polite people.

### Mailing list

We do have a mailing list available [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ccextractor-dev), and all
GitHub issues are posted here.

It's read by the right people; you can use it if you prefer it to
Slack.

### Email

If you need to use email, you can reach the organisation's admin on the
next email address: ```carlos@ccextractor.org```
