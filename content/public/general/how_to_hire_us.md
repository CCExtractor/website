If you need custom work regarding CCExtractor you can send Carlos an
email:

Carlos is currently in San Francisco.

An important thing: CCExtractor changes always become part of the
mainstream version. We don't keep one open source version and many
private versions for clients.

Work related to CCExtractor that does not require changes to CCExtractor
itself (GUIs, monitoring system, integration with 3rd party software)
can be closed source, subject to NDAs, etc.

In general jobs are offered to everyone in the team as this encourages
developers to continue their involvement with CCExtractor. This means
that even if Carlos is the first point of contact, it's likely that
someone else from the team will be available to help with the job.
