# Slack

Slack it's a very convenient tool for team work. It comes with a number
of useful features, but the one we should be using most it's the online
chat. It saves logs which can be read at any time (so you don't have to
be online all the time not to miss things), desktop notifications and
Android/iOS apps. It can also be integrated with a number of tools such
as GitHub (to notify in channel when something has been pushed).

Everyone in the [People](People) page have been invited.
